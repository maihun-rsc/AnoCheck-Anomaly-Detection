# AnoCheck-Anomaly-Detection
This project detects anomalies in videos (e.g., abuse vs. normal behavior) using motion and optical flow features extracted with OpenCV, followed by training a Random Forest classifier with Scikit-learn. It includes feature extraction, model training, prediction, and evaluation with visualizations.
